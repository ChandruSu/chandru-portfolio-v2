# New Portfolio Site!

## V1 & V2

This is the 3rd portfolio site I have built in the last 6 years. The biggest advesery in developing and maintaining a portfolio site is the reliablity of the site hosting service.

In 2018, my first site was hosted on [000Webhost](https://www.000webhost.com/) who unceremoniously archived my site and I lost all my content - I did not save it on Github. It was made using HTML, CSS and a little bit of JQuery and was only used to store WebGL games

The second site was hosted on Heroku, and was made in Django. Whilst Django itself uses SQLite for a simple local databse, when deploying on heroku, it switches to a Postgres database. This service was originally free, but removed in November 2022 for free-tier customers.

## V3 i.e This one

import { Ltx } from "@/components/Latex";

This site is built with NextJS, and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (the creators of NextJS). Whilst I can't speak to the reliability of Vercel for long-term hosting, as they may pull a Heroku down the line, I would definitely commend them on having a holistic hosting service with many well-thoughtout products that enhance the developer experience

Setting up the built pipeline and connecting it to a Github repository for automatic deployment was simple. Configuring the DNS records to set the domain name was a piece of cake, and Vercel even offer _[limited]_ postgres and redis services. Vercel also allows for preview builds, to view a PR on a staging environment and even using Vercel's Toolbar to leave notes and share feedback with your team

### Tooling

Here is a full list of tools and platforms used to build this site:

- NextJS for routing, SSR and ISR
- React for UI, no component libs used
- TailwindCSS
- MDX - to enable simple markdown posts that get converted into React
- ThreeJS (just barely)
- Cloudflare for DNS
- Giscus for the comment sections under each post
- The `react-latex-next` package for <Ltx val="\LaTeX"/> support
- Vercel for hosting

Outside of purchasing the domain name, everything required to build and host this site was free.

## Why tho...

I wanted a website, also on the rare occasions where a site prompts me for my website or _"all other relevant links"_, I feel bad not providing one.
